                        <p>The game is open to anyone willing to put their knowledge to the test in a series of
                            questions and answers. Just keep your wits about you, have fun, and get rich! So if you&rsquo;re

                            <p>The game consists of 15 questions. The level of difficulty increases with each question,
                                and so does your potential wealth. For example, if you answer the first set of questions
                                correctly your prize money goes from $100 to $1000. As you work your way through the
                                questions by supplying the correct answers your riches grow exponentially until you
                                reach the final question - and if you answer it correctly you will succeed in making a
                                million dollars!</p>

                                got what it takes? Then go ahead and play! Put all those random facts you&rsquo;ve
                                collected over the years to good use and turn it into a quick and easy million
                                dollars.</p>
